## [DEMO](https://angularjs.org/) page.<br />
<br />

## Project Brief

1. Search container which contains<br />
  a. A text box<br />
  b. A button or link to trigger the search<br />
  c. A container for the search results<br />
  d. 3 buttons at the bottom<br />
		i. Next button<br />
		ii. List button<br />
		iii. Tile button<br />
2. Image container<br />
3. Recent Searches Container<br />

## The Task:

1. Use the SoundCloud API to allow the user to search for anything entered in the search box. The names of the results should be displayed as a list below the textbox. Only fetch 6 results at a time.<br />

2. When clicked, the next button should display the next 6 results instead of the current results<br />

3. Keep a history of the searches for the user on the Recent Searches Container. This history should display the last 5 searches and should be available for the user in subsequent visits.<br />

4. When clicked, a search item should instigate a new search.<br />

5. When a search result is clicked, it should fly to the Image Container, fade out and the
image for the search result should fade in instead.<br />

6. When clicking the central image, embed the track below the image and make it play<br />

7. BONUS: When clicking the tile button tile the search results should tile in rows of 3
using their images. Clicking the list button should toggle back to list view. This selection should be remembered for the userâ€™s next visit.<br />
